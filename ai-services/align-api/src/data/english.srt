1
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:14,000
 What are the examples of CERATION?

2
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:19,567
So children, in the previous video you have learnt 

3
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:22,510
what is the order of objects?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,280
 Based on the characteristics of the objects, 

5
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,994
how they are arranged in large to small

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,551
or small to large order.

7
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:38,091
 And this process of arranging things 

8
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:42,349
in order is called SERIATION.

9
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:47,362
 In this video we will see some examples

10
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:52,299
of SERIATION in which we will arrange different

11
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:59,000
 people and objects in order based on their characteristics.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,712
 Today Chotu's class is going for a picnic.

13
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:07,535
 And Chotu's teacher asks all the children

14
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,656
to stand in groups of four.

15
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:14,776
 Then she asks the four children to stand

16
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:18,295
in a line in the small to large order

17
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:24,000
based on their height.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,494
 Chotu and his three other friends, Arthi, Neha and Sonu

19
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:33,962
begin to stand in a line.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,155
 First of all, being the shortest among all the four children,

21
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,837
Chotu stands in front.

22
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:47,077
 Neha, who is taller than him

23
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:51,754
but shorter than the rest, stands behind him.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Sonu stands behind Neha.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Then finally, Arthi stands behind Sonu.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,133
 But Sonu just notices that he is taller than Neha 

27
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:09,503
but falls to notice that Arthi is 

28
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:13,751
shorter than him.

29
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:16,851
 So children are Chotu and his friends

30
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,982
standing in the correct order of height.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,915
 Chotu and Neha are standing in the right order

32
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:29,813
but Sonu and Arthi are not.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,759
 Arthi realizes this as she is not able to

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,096
see anything by standing behind Sonu.

35
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:42,589
 Therefore, Arthi should have stood in front of Sonu

36
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:45,997
as she is shorter than Sonu in height

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 but makes Sonu realize his mistake.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,770
 Sonu, just now you saw that you are taller

39
00:02:56,788 --> 00:03:00,226
than Neha but you did not see that

40
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,488
I am also shorter than you.

41
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:06,303
 I am taller than Neha and shorter than you.

42
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:09,753
 So I should stand behind Neha

43
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,516
whereas I should stand in front of you.

44
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:17,000
 Oh yes Arthi, you are absolutely right.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,717
 So children while making the order

46
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:25,037
Sonu saw that he was taller than the children standing

47
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:27,408
 in front but he did not see

48
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,915
whether the children who were not standing in the line 

49
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:34,000
are shorter in height than Sonu and hence

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 he made this mistake.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,211
 Finally, Chotu and three of his friends

52
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,028
stood in the correct increasing order 

53
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:51,000
 of their height that is from short to tall.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Children raised the bar for picnic.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 There Chotu and his friends decide to play seven stones.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,829
 First of all, Arthi and Chotu start making a pile of stones 

57
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:12,000
based on their size from big to small.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 For this, Arthi gathers four stones from the surrounding.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Then she puts the biggest stone at the bottom.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,844
 To keep the rest of the stones, 

61
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,903
she asks for Chotu's help.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,846
 Chotu now out of the remaining three stones 

63
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:34,899
put the largest stone on this stone.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,800
 But Arthi, why are we placing these stones 

65
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:42,175
in the big to small order?

66
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:46,175
 If he plays a large size stone 

67
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,986
on a small size stone, then it will fall down 

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,914
 because its balance will be disturbed.

69
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:55,425
 Look Chotu just like this.

70
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:59,322
 Therefore, we will place a big stone at the bottom 

71
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:02,571
and then smaller than that so that 

72
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:06,989
the balance of the stones is maintained.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Oh, okay.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
 Now out of the remaining two stones 

75
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:16,647
put the big stone on top of these two stones.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Alright Arthi.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And now let's also put the large stone.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Very good Chotu.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Now our stone pile is ready.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Come on.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,586
 Let's place seven stones now.

82
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:34,828
 Children, in this example you saw how Chotu 

83
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:39,145
and Arthi made a pile of stones by keeping them

84
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:42,428
 in the decreasing order of their size 

85
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:47,253
one by one that is from large to small size.

86
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:55,000
So children tell me, did you enjoy seeing examples of seriation?

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Okay, so that's all for today.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,022
 In this video we have learned 

89
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,361
how to organize different people or objects 

90
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:12,000
 in order from small to large or from large to small.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I hope you have understood this topic properly.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Bye friends.
